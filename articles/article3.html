            <h1>Detective Pikachu trailer shows Pikachu with visible fur</h1>
            <p>Warner Bros. Pictures</p>
            <time datetime="15-11-2018">10 days ago</time>
            <p>Not only is Pikachu a deep-voiced Ryan Reynolds in May 2019 movie Detective Pikachu, but, as shown in the new trailer, the electric gerbil looks more like a real-life rodent than ever, thanks to the addition of textured fur – a new look that could play into future entries of the game franchise.</p>
            
            <p>If Pikachu has a voice, it's usually a high-pitched squeal – "Pika pika!" – as decreed by 22 years of games, cartoons, animated movies, and assorted merchandising.</p>

            <p>Yet May 2019 live-action and CGI movie Pokémon: Detective Pikachu has one of the Pokémon universe's cutest creatures speak in human language with a deeper voice.</p>
            
            <p>Ryan Reynolds of Deadpool fame was cast in December 2017, giving fans time to get used to the prospect of a more dryly humorous lead.</p>
            
            <p>Even so, the debut trailer for Pokémon: Detective Pikachu still had a big surprise in store: its Pikachu and his cohorts have a new look too.</p>

            <figcaption><p><em>Rather than sporting his customary smooth yellow coat, the title character of Detective Pikachu goes back to the source,

            <article id="sony1">
            <p>The whole bestiary has been given a more realistic makeover for this Pokémon-and-people adventure, though it's the fluffy animals that stand out and go beyond mere incremental evolution.

            Yes, fire-breathing dragon Charmander has scaly skin, and frog-like Greninja warriors are clammy, but sweet Jigglypuff is both downy and menacing; a frazzled duck-platypus hybrid Psyduck looks more harried than ever.</p>

            <p>Well, there might be a chance. The Pokémon Company is willing to experiment, as this week's Nintendo Switch release Pokémon, Let's Go demonstrates.
                
            Not only does it take on elements from 2017's massive mobile hit Pokémon Go to become more welcoming to console newcomers, its team had even explored a photorealistic approach early in development.</p>
                
            <p>That there's a market for more realistic-looking monster collection games was proven by Monster Hunter: World. Debuting in January this year, it became an enormous success, the fastest-selling and overall best-selling game in its well-established publisher's 34-year history.</p>
                
            <p>However, after Pokémon Go and Pokémon, Let's Go, Game Freak and The Pokémon Company assured long-term fans that a more traditional franchise entry was in the works for 2019 – so we might be waiting a while yet for that more tactile-looking in-game Pikachu. – AFP Relaxnews</p>
